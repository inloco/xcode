# xcode

Xcode is a complete developer toolset for creating apps for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Xcode brings user interface design, coding, testing, debugging, and submitting to the App Store into a unified workflow.

This repository contains a job to programatically download Xcode, using phone validation from icloud (using message bird) and save it on ECR.
